            <p class="text-center text-dark">Back in 2004, Our Founder and President Mr. Mrinal Kanti Bhanja noticed a <b>very common problem</b>: “About how the youth of our country are ignorant of the social problems that exist in our country”. He
		    identified <b>two major bottlenecks</b> about why youth lacked social commitment:</p>
		<p class="text-center text-dark" style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Firstly</b>, the social problems aren’t portrayed well in the <b>bookish knowledge</b> which people gain through the curriculum and hence are generally unaware of the real scenario at the grass-root level.
            It can only be understood by real-life experiences by encountering these problems.</p>
		<p class="text-center text-dark" style="font-size: 16px;"><b>Secondly</b>, even if they are well aware of the real-world scenarios there was a <b>lack of platform or proper guidance & a team of like-minded people</b> to execute their ideas regarding existing social problems.
            This gap could only be filled through early exposure to these social problems. We have to motivate the youth of our country to consider these bottlenecks in our country’s progress as their
            own problems and provide them with a platform to execute their solutions and develop problem-solving skills.
                The zeal to fill this gap became the cause of the birth of the Gopali Youth Welfare Society.

		    A <b>total student-run organization</b> started back in 2004, We are now managing a school for underprivliged children of their own, providing quality education to more than <b>250 underprivileged students</b> from the
              areas in and around Kharagpur. We also conduct skill development programs like tailoring, computer training, etc, and have many other small initiatives with an annual budget of around <b>30+ Lakhs</b> managed
              solely by a group of students from IIT Kharagpur.<br><br>
              After the success of strategies and plans of the Gopali Youth Welfare Society (GYWS) near the area of IIT Kharagpur ,the society planned to reciprocate similar models of social upliftment throughout the
              nation so as to create a greater impact by spreading knowledge and experience gained through such long journey of social service and hence came up with the initiative named LIGHT to reach to
              masses all over India.<button onclick="changeContent()" id="about-read-less">..read less</button></span></p>

					Gopali Youth Welfare Society was founded with a sole vision to involve the educated youth in social
					work. The idea was to make them aware of the situation in their surroundings and motivate them to work
					for it. Back in the 2000s, I used to notice how the students after getting education start aiming for lucrative jobs
					and work for Multi-National companies. I used to ask myself whether they actually know about what is going
					on in their surroundings, How one section of the society is still suffering while others are enjoying the luxury
					which life has to offer. I started the Gopali Youth Welfare Society with an aim to make them aware of these
					situations which are a bottleneck to the country's progress and help them use their creative brains for solving
					the nation's problems at the ground level.

				<p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px">
					We have been successful in motivating a pool of students from IIT Kharagpur & GYWS is a prime example

					everybody across the country.

					Gopali Youth Welfare Society has acted as a prime example of how involving the youth of the country into social work can not only help us solve the nation's social problem but also help us provide life-skills to the members involved.

					We at LiGHT are working very hard to deliver a similar platform to the future leaders of the country to come forward and carve the path to the Nation's Development.

				<p style="padding-left:20px;padding-right:20px">
					Our aim is to form a network of student-run centers like ours across the country so that whenever any student has an amazing idea about solving a problem, he or she should know exactly how to execute those.

                        95% of our income. Taken together, it is these seemingly small contributions that
                        collectively add
                        up to
                        a
                        large amount needed to effect change. There are people all over who are concerned about the
                        situation
                        and who
                        want to do something to change it. However, their own commitments and pressures do not allow
                        them to
                        go
                        out
                        and directly work with situation. LiGHT provides them the opportunity to help in whatever
                        way they
                        can.
                        They
                        can contribute their money, materials, time, or skills. When everybody comes together and
                        pitches
                        in, no
                        task
                        is impossible. This COLLECTIVE ACTION has an impact and brings about change. Every
                        individual’s
                        contribution
                        is important. This is the fundamental principle on which LiGHT functions.
